## Overview

This website is dedicated to raising awareness about the critical issue of food waste and encouraging users to take action by providing food waste to us to explit it and recycling it in to valuable materials. It educates users on the environmental, economic, and social impacts of food waste and facilitates the donation process through a simple contact form. By learning about the problem and filling out the form, users can help reduce food waste by giving it to us.

### The project

Users should understand:

- The critical issue of food waste
